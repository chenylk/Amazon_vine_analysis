# Amazon_vine_analysis

## Overview
  * The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon Vine reviews for grocery data to determine any trends in customer approval. 

## Results
  * There were a total of 61 Vine reviews and 28,287 non-Vine reviews counted for items that were considered helpful reviews.
  * The Vine subscribers had 20 five star reviews while non-Vine subscribers had 15689 five star reviews.
  * Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews had five star percentages of 32.77 and 55.46, respectively.

## Summary
  * There is no positivity bias in the reviews for the Vine program. This outcome is the opposite of what I anticipated. The non-Vine reviews had a much higher percentage of being 5 star, by 22.69% specifically. Thus, being a vine-member did not cause a positivity bias in the reviews. Another analysis that could have been done to further this argument is to look at the verified_purchase column. Some of the non-vine members could have given false stars without actually buying the product. This would skew the data slightly and could paint a different picture about the bias in reviews among Vine members.
